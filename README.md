Synthetic Instrumental Variable Method R-package

The package estimates a linear regressions with one endogeneous variable using three different techniques of the SIV method.The essense of the mthod is in construction of a synthetic IV using  $s = x + k \delta r$, where $x$ is the endogenous variable in the reduced form, and $r$ is a vector determined in the plane spanned by the outcome variable $y$ and endogenous variable $x$. Vector $r$ is constructed as an orthogonal vector to $x$. 
The first method is a simple SIv method that assumes homoscedasdicity of the error term. This method implies that if we synthesize such an  SIV,  s*, that satisfies E(s*'e'e) = 0, then, E(s*u) = 0 also must hold.Thus, in this case, the SIV method determines a valid SIV such that \mbox{$E({\bf  u\mid s^*=z_0})=0$}   by \mbox{${\bf s^*}={\bf x}+k\delta_0 {\bf r}$}  where \mbox{$\delta_0= \operatorname*{arg\,}_{\delta}[E({\bf  ee'\mid s^*})=0]$,} and $\bf e$ is the first-stage error term. Then, $\beta$, the  parameter in  \eqref{e2}, is identified by an IV estimator: $\hat{\beta}_{IV}={\bf(x's^*)^{-1} x'y}$.}
